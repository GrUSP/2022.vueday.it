        talk_description: "Most of the time while developing a Vue application developers tend to downprioritise  both Testing and Accessibility.
        In the past few years developers got a bit better when it comes to testing, but still adding no focus towards Accessibility, usually because there is 'too much thinking' about learning, implementing and testing it.
        What if there was a nice way to develop accessible Vue applications? Would you be willing to do it? What about legislation related to Accessibility? Maybe there is a lot to learn, but it can be simpler if you know where to start with."

        We'll see how an Image Service CDN and other performance optimization techniques, such as responsive images, sizing attributes, lazy loading, and nice placeholders, will allow us to improve the UX and performance in a very easy way.
        How? By creating an image gallery made with Nuxt 3 and a headless CMS, allowing us to experience the functionalities of a powerful integrated Image Transformation API and Editor, and creating an image Vue component that can be used in any situation."

        Creating a reusable component that will solve these problems can be tricky. What is the right balance between specific and generic? When the component is abstract and composable enough? How to ensure consistency and follow design guidelines?
        In this talk, we‚Äôll cover the anatomy and principles of reusable components, we‚Äôll see them sparkling in a giant codebase, and evaluate their benefits. I‚Äôll share how we keep our 1500 buttons consistent and maintainable across the giant codebase."

        In this show, I will create a dApp in which the user can authenticate to a certain blockchain. Surprisingly, this can be completely anonymous. Some magic props and tools will be used like Vue 3, a Metamask wallet, and more.
